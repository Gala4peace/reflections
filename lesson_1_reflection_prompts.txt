How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    you can step back and see where the glitches are

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    having to save each time, makes you more aware of the changes you are
    making in any given version you are working on and it allows you to
    collaborate in more effectively

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    because they were thought for two different user groups with two different
    users needs in mind

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    checkout and commit - pull

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    I can revert back to a previous version, re-instate the original version and
    merge it to the master again

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    checkout and commit branches
